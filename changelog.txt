- Openelec Users – fixed missing source flag in multiple views
- Extended flags added to VideoInfo screen
- VideoInfo – Tagline width adjusted to avoid overlap onto Discart
- Fixed Home Menu Icon customizer: When editing/customizing Widget items, i.e., backgrounds etc, focus position changes to a random icon. Main menu customizer did not exhibit this behavior when using text labels.
- List View: Fixed rounded poster cover view settings– TOP 250 info falls outside background image – original issue with the skin

- Changed positioning of VideoPlayer plot should user choose not to include poster

- Manage dialog now includes these additional items;

o Imdb Updater – requires script.ratingupdate-1.3.9.zip. See readme accompanied with script before launching as php-cgi is required
o TvTunes and Video Extras added
o Cinema Experience (cannot get this addon to function and the issue is not skin related)

- Removed “Group Extras on Video Info, TvTunes, Vdeo Extras, Cinema” as they these addons can now be launched from the Manage menu
- Live TV Capability Enabled – Thanks to R3N3 for implementing his mod based off of  Maniac’s LiveTv mod
 
Thanks to schimi2k for his continued support in enhancing this skin. He spent numerous hours testing for bugs. He also developed new textures for the skin as he discovered there were images that were
sized incorrectly and pixelated; as a result he did a complete re-design of those images. He also made numerous suggestions on how to improve the skin.

Thanks to R3N3 for implementing his mod based off of Maniac’s LiveTV mod.

Thanks to manfeed for his great Alternative layout for Music Visualization+Lyrics mod.
